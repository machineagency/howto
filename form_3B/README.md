## Rules

1. This is one of the machines that you can operate alone. Be responsible for
   your print and clean after you finish.
2. Always wear gloves when handling resin and washing solvent
3. Read this whole SOP before using the machine for the first time

## Important Information and Safety

1. This machine uses a highly volatile solvent to post-process the printed
   parts. You’ll need appropriate EH&S trainings before we know that you can
   keep yourself safe from any health and physical hazard.

## Materials

If you have questions about acceptable materials, contact the machine manager.
They can add additional materials to this list if needed.

### Acceptable Materials

Only compatible Form 3 cartridges can be installed on this machine. Visit
[this website](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/What-Formlabs-resins-work-with-the-new-Form-3?language=en_US)
for more information.

### Unacceptable Materials

- Anything you cook in your kitchen
- Anything you mix up in your garage
- Anything that is not Form 3 compatible
- However, printing customized resin is possible with some tweaking. Contact
  machine manager if you wish to print rare but exciting materials.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Quick start guide

A thorough introduction to the Formlabs 3 is
[available online](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Quick-Start-Guide-Form3?language=en_US)
and there are
[tons of detailed procedures for operating the machine](https://support.formlabs.com/s/topic/0TO1Y000000IvzXWAS/overview-form-3?language=en_US).
It is a good resource for beginners.

### Before using the machine

1. Wear gloves and eye protection in case of a spill or allergic reaction to the
   resin.
2. Follow
   [design specifications](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Design-specifications-for-3D-models-form-3?language=en_US)
   and adjust your models if needed.

### While using the machine

1. Prepare your model and slice it with the latest version of
   [Preform](https://formlabs.com/software/).
2. [Select](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Selecting-a-printer-in-PreForm)
   or
   [manually add](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Manually-adding-a-printer-to-PreForm?language=en_US)
   a printer in PreForm.
3. Match PreForm consumables (resin tank, resin cartridge) to consumables
   inserted in printer or vice versa.
4. [Send the print job from PreForm to the printer.](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Sending-a-print-job-from-PreForm-to-a-printer)
5. Once transferred from PreForm to the printer, start the print from the
   printer. The machine needs to be primed. This step can go before #5 and it
   takes about two minutes. Go to the home screen on the printer and click
   ‘Prime’. Follow the instructions on the screen.

## When you have finished using the machine

1. Take off your print(s). Use plastic tools to help scrape off the print
   carefully. Do not use any sharp and metal tools against the build platform.
2. If the build platform is not in touch with anything, put it back. Otherwise
   use Form wash to clean the surface.
3. Close all lids on all machines! If you don’t, the resin will cure and attract
   dust, the washing solvent will evaporate, and who knows what will happen to
   the UV lightbox.
