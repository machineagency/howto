## Terms

Sewing machine parts and their functions: https://youtu.be/MC9nYWY9F6Q

## Rules

- Turn machine off and put away in box when you’re finished!
- This machine is designed for lightweight materials. Don’t force super heavy
  materials through this machine, such as too many layers of denim, or hard
  plastic or other materials that are likely to break it. If the needle is
  stalling or breaking/bending, your material is too much!
- Clean up your fabric and thread scraps when you’re done - don’t leave a mess!
- Important Information and Safety
- Needles are sharp, obviously keep your fingers clear of the moving needle.
- Related to #1: take your foot off of the pedal while threading the top and
  bottom threads.
- If you are sewing an unusual material and might have needle breakage, wear eye
  protection.

## Materials

If you have questions about acceptable materials, contact the machine manager.
They can add additional materials to this list if needed.

### Acceptable Materials

- Lightweight fabrics of all fibers
- Paper
- Soft plastics, lightweight leathers, & vinyl (use discretion)

### Unacceptable Materials

- Very heavy fabrics or way too many layers of material
- Hard plastics, leathers, etc. that are difficult to punch through

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Before using the machine

- Find a suitable table
- Ensure the switch is turned off
- Plug in the foot pedal/power cord
- Thread the machine and bobbin (see manual or video tutorials below)
- Select your stitch style and length

### While using the machine

- This machine operates like any standard sewing machine, see manual, tutorials,
  or machine manager for specific use instructions.

### When you have finished using the machine

- Turn off the machine, remove the power/pedal cord, and put it all back in the
  box with the manual.
- CLEAN UP YOUR THREAD BITS (especially if you’re working near chairs with
  wheels!)

## Best Practices

If your stitch line doesn’t look right, try these troubleshooting steps in this
order:

- Remove the bobbin, check that it’s threaded correctly in the bobbin casing,
  and reinsert.
- Rethread the machine.
- Replace the needle if it is old, dull, or damaged. Check if you need a
  different sized or specialty needle for your particular materials and use
  case.
- Adjust the top or bottom thread tension. (tutorial below)

## Tips and Tricks

- Holding the thread ends taut when starting a stitch may help prevent the
  bobbin thread from being ugly.
- Special threads (shiny, conductive, thick, etc) may require special needles,
  slower speeds, or other care.
