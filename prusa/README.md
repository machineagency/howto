   printing.

## Materials

See Prusa’s Knowledge Base of Acceptable Materials.

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Before using the machine

1. Download Prusa Slicer and use this software to go from digital model (STL
   file) to G-Code file. More information on which settings you should use while
   slicing the STL file can be found on the Prusa Slicer website. In most cases,
   the default settings will work fine.
2. Ensure that the machine has an SD card in its slot. If not, somebody must
   have stolen it—please ping the lab and demand they return it.
3. Power on the machine by flipping the switch near the power source near the
   leadscrews.
4. Load your G-Code onto the SD card and insert it back into the machine.
5. This machine uses lab communal filament, although you can use your own. I
   recommend using the built-in procedure to do so—check menu options using the
   Prusa front button.
6. If you are printing with ABS filament, open a window and turn on a fan on low
   and point it towards the window and machine. Alternatively, turn on a HEPA
   air filter next to the machine.

### While using the machine

7. Make sure the first layer adheres to the bed before walking away. If the
   first layer fails, cancel the print by pressing the front button on the Prusa
   and selecting “abort.” Then, try your print again using different settings.
   You can leave this machine on overnight.

### When you have finished using the machine

8. Clear your print or any failed filament from the bed and dispose of it in the
   proper bin. Keep in mind that PLA filament is commercially compostable.
9. Turn off the machine when it’s not in use.

## Common Issues

- If filament is not extruding, make sure the extruder gear on the print head is
  correctly engaging with and feeding the filament through when turning. You can
  turn the extruder gear manually in the Prusa menu.
- If the filament gear is turning properly, check for clogs in the feed tube. If
  you can’t locate any issues, stop using the printer and contact Jasper.
