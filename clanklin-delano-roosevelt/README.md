# Clanklin Delano Roosevelt (Clank XY)

Last updated on 3 May 2023

This is the Standard Operating Procedure for the Machine Agency Clank XY machine. While this machine can use several end effectors, this document assumes it will be used for **milling**. For questions about this machine, contact the machine
manager.

Clank XY was designed by Jake Read. [His documentation for the machine can be found here](https://clank.tools/).

| #2 Equipment                                  | Clank machine, a workpiece to be milled (e.g. wood, PCB blank, Delrin), and fixturing materials (clamps and/or tape), collet wrenches. |
| #3 Personal Protective Equipment PPE)         | Ear and eye protection are both required. An N-95 mask is needed if milling wood, foam, or PCB blanks. Tie back long hair, jewelry, and clothing.   |
| #4 Environmental/Ventilation controls         | Run the machine in Sieg 112 with the dust filter on.                              |
| #5 Required training or approval              | Must be trained by machine manager.                                               |
| #6 Inspection requirements before use         | The workpiece must be fastened securely.                                                         |
| #7 Safe operating procedures or precautions   | Machine must be watched at all times while milling. Use the emergency stop if needed.                                       |
| #8 Chemicals/ spill procedures/waste disposal | N/A                                         |

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Plug in the power supply to an outlet. Note that there is no on/off switch, just whether the power supply is plugged in or not.
2. Plug in the ethernet cable to your computer. If this is the first time your computer is connecting to the machine, [follow these instructions](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Connecting_to_Jubilee).
3. Navigate to `192.168.1.2/` in a web browser. When prompted for a password, it is `clanklin`.
4. Home the **Y axis FIRST**, using either the GUI or `G28 Y`. Ensure that cables are out of the way of the end stops which are optical. Note that the controller won't let you move on an axis until it is homed.
5. Home the X and Z axes similarly, order does not matter here.
6. Fixture your workpiece.
7. Install the end mill in the collet by using the collet wrenches. Keep the collet very loose around the end mill for now.
8. To zero the X axis, loosen the collet until the bit sits on top of the workpiece. If you need to, move the Z axis up or down so enough of the end mill shaft is engaged with the collet.
9. Once satisfied, tighten the collet and set the Z axis position to zero using the G-code `G92 Z0`.
10. Raise the Z-axis by 5mm or so i.e. `G0 Z5`.
11. In the Duet interface, upload a G-code file user `File Management > System`, then run it by right clicking the file and pressing Run. **NOTE:** please see the note about setting spindle speeds belowâ€”you will most likely need to manually edit any generated G-Code files to address this.

## Best Practices

 WARNING: the current design of the spindle and motor is not ideal. Because we're using a brushless DC motor wired directly to the controller, the spindle cannot increase its RPM by more than 4000RPM or so per second. There is currently no automatic ramping functionality for this. 
 
 **This, it is your responsibility to never increase the RPM by more than 4000RPM at once.** This means you need to manually set RPM and then dwell incrementally, including in any G-code files you send to it. As an example, to set the spindle to 12000RPM:
 
```
M03 S5000
G04 S1
M03 S10000
G04 S1
M03 S12000
G04 S1
```

If you don't do this, the current from the power supply will drop too quickly and reset the controller board.
